Stubs directory contains a stand-alone version of interval assignment that runs under xcode and its debugger,
that doesn't depend on the rest of Meshkit.
This directory contains alternative file to the "../MeshKit/" IAInterface.hpp and IAVariable.hpp files,
the ../IAInterface.cpp file, and the /trunk/MKVersion.h file

/src/core/meshkit/Error.hpp
/src/core/meshkit/MeshScheme.hpp
