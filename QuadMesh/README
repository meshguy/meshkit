            JQuad:  All Quadrilateral Mesh Generator
	  *******************************************

Introduction:  Given a triangle mesh, JQuad converts it into All Quadrilateral
mesh. If the number of edges on the boundaries is even, then it will not put
any steiner point on the boundary.

The present algorithm is a in-between Edmonds' Perfect Graph Matching
algorithm and Suneeta's All Convex Quadrilateral mesh generation scheme.
Both Edmonds's perfect graph matching algorithm and Suneeta's QPercolation
algorithm are expensive and therefore certain things are relaxed in this
algorithm to performance consideration.

How to compile:
***************

The code depends on MOAB and Mesquite Software. So please download and install
them on your machine first and then use Makefile to reflect their path then
just write
      Make

This will generate "JQuad" executable. At present, the input triangle mesh
is in "Triangle" mesh format.

Usage: Example dataset sq.1.ele sq.1.node

      JQuad sq.1

This will generate quad0.vtk and quad1.vtk. quad1.vtk uses Laplacian Smoothing
on the quad0.vtk, therefore the mesh will have better quality.
