Version 1.4.1 (SIGMA v1.2.1)
============================

Fixes:
------
  1) Bug in rectangular assembly orientation in AssyGen and CoreGen. The orientation is as it is described in the input file, instead of being  mirrored.
  2) Linking issues on OSX.

Enhancements:
-------------
  1) Added timing to AssyGen for CGM boolean operations.
  2) Improved CoreGen parallel save time, (deleting GEOM_DIMENSION tag before parallel save). Also , saving only Material and Neumann sets in the final mesh.3. Added PARALLEL_PARTITION tag to the final mesh created by parallel CoreGen.
  3) Added support for HEX27 element creation in CoreGen. User may specify HEX8 or HEX27 in the input file.
  4) CoreGen keyword 'MESHTOGEOM' supported for CUBIT mesh files. A new tool mbmeshtogeom in MOAB can be used to compute MESHTOGEOM ratio on an already existing mesh file.

Version 1.4  (SIGMA v1.2)
=========================

Fixes:
------

  1) A new tools directory is introduced with AssyGen, CoreGen and PostBL as tools.
  2) CoreGen has been optimized and found to be 10-20% faster using the graph-based design.
  3) Several valgrind and warning fixes have been applied.
  4) Bugs found during the development of AssyMesher in TFIMapping and CGM have been fixed.
  5) Fix conflicts between multiple instances of OneToOneSwept from existence of tags and marking of shared nodes.
  6) Fix multiple layer creation when creating tet layers from prim layers, indices were incorrect.

Enhancements:
-------------

  1) New AssyGen boundary layer generation feature is added, this has been exposed via RGG GUI by Kitware.
  2) MESHTOGEOM tag and o/p file has developed in RGG workflow for PROTEUS to compute ratio of mesh to geometric volume.
  3) New routines due to CGM and MOAB updatation.
  4) Using quality check from MOAB in PostBL for modified penultimate hexes. Program exits if negative Jacobian is encountered.

Notable Features:
-----------------

  1) Old MeshKit/algs, MeshKit/utils and MeshKit/rgg are deleted. RGG tools CoreGen and AssyGen are fully functional
     and adhere to the graph-based scheme.
  2) Added a new MeshOp FacetMeshReader.
  3) Lasso has been removed as a dependency. MOAB must now be configured --with-irel option for building MeshKit.
  4) AssyMesher: A new MeshOp for meshing OCC (.brep) type reactor assembly meshes generated by AssyGen has been added.

Version 1.3  (SIGMA v1.1)
=========================

Fixes:
------

  1) Fixes and new enhancements to PostBL, using new mesh quality support from MOAB.
  2) Name all Neumann sets created by CoreGen (RGG).
  3) Fixes to building make_watertight on OSX.
  4) Fixed several warnings.
  5) Fixes to shared builds and make distcheck.
  6) Bug fixes for rectangular assembly arrangement in CoreGen.

Enhancements:
-------------

  1) Improvements to configure script for Mesquite, TetGen etc.
  2) New RGG example with shifting material and Neumann sets for creating new assemblies.

Version 1.2  (SIGMA v1.0)
=========================
See details on compatibility with dependent libraries in NEWS section of http://sigma.mcs.anl.gov

A. BUG FIXES
------------
  1) Various RGG (AssyGen/CoreGen) bugfixes and enhancements: common keywords inputs, superblocks,
     automated multiple file creation, automatic mesh size specification, scheme spefication for hole surfaces etc.
  2) Fixes to OneToOneSweep: new test case added
  3) Fixes to PostBL along with addition of methods to create mixed element meshes.
  4) Fixes to quadmesher and removed dependency on BOOST.

B. NEW FEATURES
---------------
  1) A new version of make_watertight for sealing faceted CAD Geometry, see page: http://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/?p=901
     Note: Use with MOAB 4.7.0 or higher.
     A program called check_watertight for evaluating model integrity for use with ray-firing has been included as well.
  2) RGG AssyGen feature to "CreateFiles" and "CreateMatFiles". CoreGen feature "same_as" to shift material/boundaries while loading the same mesh file.
  3) Load file with geometry group sets (see: test/core/test_load_grps.cpp)
  4) Routines with 21 options for quad mesh cleanup have been added (test/algs/test_quadmeshcleanup)
  5) RGG GUI has been developed by Kitware and is available for download from: http://cmb.kitware.com/CMB/resources/software.html
      CMB website: http://cmb.kitware.com/CMB/project/cmbnuclear.html

C. API CHANGES
--------------
  1) Fixes to get_entities_by_dimension and get_entities_by_handle.
     These functions will now return ModelEnts of dimension 4 if requested.
     If the dimension passed in is -1, the function will return all ModelEnts in the MK instance.
  2) Correction to the ModelEnt constructor for iGeom EntSets.

D. FUTURE WORK
--------------
  1) B-Rep(OCC)-based mesh generation, Solid Geometry Mesher-based on CGM, this will add the capability of
     meshing and manipulating solid geometry models based on OpenCascade and CUBIT.
  2) Open source tri-mesher
  3) Integration of verdict-mesh quality evalulation library
  4) Interval assignment integration with existing algorithms
  5) New parallel schemes and optimization of RGG tools: AssyGen and CoreGen.
  6) Parallel mesh generation
