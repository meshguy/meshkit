!
! This is input file runs the test case with a background mesh (Y shaped) and copy/move merges 3 assemblies (pin1.cub) on Y and extrudes the resulting model in Z-direction
!
ProblemType Geometry
Geometry Volume         	 ! 'Geometry' card defines if the meshes are volume or surface
!
Symmetry 6			 ! 'Symmetry' card defines the desired symmetry in the model
!
GeometryType hexflat    	 ! 'GeometryType' card can take values Hexagonal Cartesian and Default
!
Assemblies 1 15.685     	 ! 'Assemblies' card defines there is one assembly with pitch 15.685 (Note this should takecare of background mesh)
pin1_occ.stp  A1      	         ! Meshfile name followed by alias
!
Lattice 2           	         ! 'Lattice' card defines core had 2 rings next define these rings based on Aliases
A1 &
A1 A1 	        	         ! Assembly arrangement must be in one line, Note the usage of '&' sign, it signals continuation of input in the next line
!
!
Background test_sodium_all_occ.stp	 ! Background mesh file 
!
OutputFileName test_geom_occ.stp   ! twoassm_out.h5m is the desired o/p file name
