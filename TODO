MESHKIT TODO LIST

## New Algorithms
1. Add parallel quad mesh generation algorithm
2. Adaptive mesh generation (AHF from MOAB)
3. Hex mesh generation using Jaal or tet-to-hex

## Enhancements
1. Improve triangle AdvFront algorithm (integrate and test hard geometries) and also test performace on GPU's etc.
2. Optimize and simplify parallel tet meshing algorithm
3. AssyMesher Material/Neumann set/tag creation based of reactor part names specified in the input file
4. Utilize MBMesquite in AdvFront algorithm
5. Structured mesh generation examples
6. Mesh generation (refinement) for climate and earth systems models

## Configuration
1. Add python bindings using Cython
2. Support external dependencies with CMake based build
3. Create and distribute package installers for Mac (Homebrew), Windows (CMake) and Ubuntu(apt-get)

## Integration
1. Use IntervalMatching algorithms for create a hex meshing algorithm using the component algorithms
2. Kitware CMB integration and open-source RGG GUI
