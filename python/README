Installation
============

The following steps describe how to get the Python bindings for MeshKit up and
running. This will hopefully become simpler in the future as various
installation bugs are worked out.

1) Install SWIG 1.3 using your preferred method (e.g. Synaptic)
2) Build CGM, MOAB, and Lasso with --enable-shared
3) Download and untar PyTAPS from <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyTAPS>, or get
   the latest source from <https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/python/trunk>
   a) Run "python setup.py install"
   b) Run "python setup.py install_headers"
4) Build MeshKit with --enable-shared, --enable-python, and --with-camal
5) Make sure the headers from (3b) are in your CPATH, e.g. if your headers were
   installed to "/usr/include/python/PyTAPS/<file>.h", your CPATH should contain
   "/usr/include/python"
6) cd into meshkit/python and run "python setup.py install"
   Note: You may need to run this twice, due to a bug in how SWIG extensions get
   built.
7) Run some examples from meshkit/python/examples to make sure that installation
   worked
