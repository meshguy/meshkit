ToDO:
1. Enable --with-vtk to Moab, which means including vtk in superbuild
2. moab can be built with cgm support?? --with-cgm
3. Add MPI back into the mix
4. Make more stuff optional ( tetgen, triangle, OCE, etc )
5. Add a test step to everything to make sure the projects are properly built


Notes:
1. autoconf step requires autoconf to be installed and libtool to be installed
