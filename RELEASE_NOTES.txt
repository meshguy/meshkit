Version 1.2  (SIGMA v1.0)
=========================
See details on compatibility with dependent libraries in NEWS section of http://sigma.mcs.anl.gov

A. BUG FIXES
------------
  1) Various RGG (AssyGen/CoreGen) bugfixes and enhancements: common keywords inputs, superblocks,
     automated multiple file creation, automatic mesh size specification, scheme spefication for hole surfaces etc.
  2) Fixes to OneToOneSweep: new test case added
  3) Fixes to PostBL along with addition of methods to create mixed element meshes.
  4) Fixes to quadmesher and removed dependency on BOOST.

B. NEW FEATURES
---------------
  1) A new version of make_watertight for sealing faceted CAD Geometry, see page: http://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/?p=901
     Note: Use with MOAB 4.7.0 or higher.
     A program called check_watertight for evaluating model integrity for use with ray-firing has been included as well.
  2) RGG AssyGen feature to "CreateFiles" and "CreateMatFiles". CoreGen feature "same_as" to shift material/boundaries while loading the same mesh file.
  3) Load file with geometry group sets (see: test/core/test_load_grps.cpp)
  4) Routines with 21 options for quad mesh cleanup have been added (test/algs/test_quadmeshcleanup)
  5) RGG GUI has been developed by Kitware and is available for download from: http://cmb.kitware.com/CMB/resources/software.html
      CMB website: http://cmb.kitware.com/CMB/project/cmbnuclear.html

C. API CHANGES
--------------
  1) Fixes to get_entities_by_dimension and get_entities_by_handle.
     These functions will now return ModelEnts of dimension 4 if requested.
     If the dimension passed in is -1, the function will return all ModelEnts in the MK instance.
  2) Correction to the ModelEnt constructor for iGeom EntSets.

D. FUTURE WORK
--------------
  1) B-Rep(OCC)-based mesh generation, Solid Geometry Mesher-based on CGM, this will add the capability of
     meshing and manipulating solid geometry models based on OpenCascade and CUBIT.
  2) Open source tri-mesher
  3) Integration of verdict-mesh quality evalulation library
  4) Interval assignment integration with existing algorithms
  5) New parallel schemes and optimization of RGG tools: AssyGen and CoreGen.
  6) Parallel mesh generation
