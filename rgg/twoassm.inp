!
! This is input file runs the test case with a background mesh (Y shaped) and copy/move merges 3 assemblies (pin1.cub) on Y 
!
Geometry Volume         	 ! 'Geometry' card defines if the meshes are volume or surface
!
GeometryType Default    	 ! 'GeometryType' card can take values Hexagonal Cartesian and Default
!
Assemblies 1 15.685     	 ! 'Assemblies' card defines there is one assembly with pitch 15.685 (Note this should takecare of background mesh)
pin1.cub  A1      	         ! Meshfile name followed by alias 
!
Lattice 2           	         ! 'Lattice' card defines core had 2 rings next define these rings based on Aliases
A1    A1 &         	         ! Assembly arrangement must be in one line, Note the usage of '&' sign, it signals continuation of input in the next line
   A1
!
Background test_sodium_all.cub   ! 'Background' card specifies the meshfile for background mesh
!
Symmetry 6	                 !  'Symmetry' card defines the desired symmetry for the o/p mesh
!
END                              ! 'END' card is a MUST marks the end of file for the file reader
