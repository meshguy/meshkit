! This is input file runs the test case with a background mesh (Y shaped) and copy/move merges 3 assemblies (pin1.cub) on Y 
!
Geometry Surface         	 ! 'Geometry' card defines if the meshes are volume or surface
Z-Height  50
Z-Divisions 10
!
Symmetry 6			 ! 'Symmetry' card defines the desired symmetry in the model
!
GeometryType hexflat    	 ! 'GeometryType' card can take values Hexagonal Cartesian and Default
!
Assemblies 1 15.685     	 ! 'Assemblies' card defines there is one assembly with pitch 15.685 (Note this should takecare of background mesh)
