Steps to build a 2 sixth core from 2 types of assys from 4 mesh files:
1, 2 and 11.cub are the block assemblies with different section.
8.cub is a VHTR assembly.

-> set the path of your cubit executable in the makefile

-> build coregen and assygen

-> from the pwd invoke 'make'

-> see the .jou files produced by assygen, the updated ones create this assembly
